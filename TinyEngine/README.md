[TinyEngine](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/tinyengine) provide the library of TinyEngine and tutorial examples for deployment. Because we transform PyTorch models into onnx, tf and tflite. The introduction of certain Transpose operators into the computation graph has led to incompatibility with the code generated by the official library. Therefore, if you have the same problems with us, please replace TfliteConvertor.py that we have provided.

If you have any better solutions, please contact us at ccsk1wsl@stu.xupt.edu.cn
